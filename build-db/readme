### Adding an entry ###

To add an entry, set config vars at the top of these scripts and run them (in this order):

scrapeSugarMegs.js
  Make sure in the output that you never see "length: 0". If the `build-smdb` script sees this, it will stop early. If this happens, either fix `build-smdb` so it continues if 0, or check out the files in the identifiers folder. If any of the ones you added are empty, remove them from the from build-smdb `ENTRIES` array.
build-smdb.js
pullDateFromTitle.js

Then remove any entries that don't have tracks:
  `db.getCollection("bob-dylan").remove({tracks: []})`

Check out all entries that don't have .mp3s:
  `db.getCollection("bob-dylan").find({ tracks : { $not: { $elemMatch: { uri : { $regex : /.mp3$/ } } } } })`

I haven't had to do any conversions yet. But keep in mind this app is shaped for archive.org entries ..
